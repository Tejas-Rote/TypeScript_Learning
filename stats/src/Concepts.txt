enums
    -Follow near-identical syntax rules as normal objects 
    -Creates an object with the same keys and calues when converted from TS to JS
    -Primary goal is to signal to other engineers that these are all closely related values
    -Use whenever we have a small fixed set of values that are all closely related and know at compile time 


Generics - 
    Like function arguments , but for types in class/functino definations
    allows us to define the type of a property/arguments/return value at a future point 
    used heavily when writing reusable code 
    
    example:
    
    class HoldAnything <TypeOfData> {
        data:TypeOfData // this is generic and need to be given when instantiating .
    }
