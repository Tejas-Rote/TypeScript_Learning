Types have 2 sub-types:
    -> primitive types = number, boolean , void , undefined , string , symbol , null
    -> object types = functions, class , arrays , objects

Object types can trick compiler into believing that one type is actually another type.

Types are used by the typescript compiler to analyze our code for errors

Types allows others to understand what values are flowing around our codebases.
