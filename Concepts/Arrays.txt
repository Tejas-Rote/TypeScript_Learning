Typed arrays    
    arrays where each element is some consistent type of value

how it is different from tuple (example)

// object representing a drink

   color   -> brown
carbonated -> true
   sugar   -> 40


// in form of tuple 

[brown, true, 40]


this looks like an array but it has a specific order of color, carbonated and sugar.
if that order is not maintained and the info in it is any arbitrary order then thats an array

[40 , true, brown]

as in tuple format it is very hard to understand hence we use the objects
